- regular healthy snacks such as apples, oranges, and bananas + granola bars are available
- invite professors/TAs to do their office hours here for certain weeks


ECE Newsletter Student of the Week each week + Student/TA of the Class each semester + Prof of the Week
- short bio to recognize ECE students for their accomplishments inside and outside of school
- TA and Student recognition for kids who helped the class succeed or were very beneficial to the class, recommended by professors
