# Goals for 2020 Session

ECE Study Hall
- Have a regular room dedicated to ECE Students to sit and do group study considering Macleod is being demolished
- regular healthy snacks such as apples, oranges, and bananas + granola bars are available
    * budget can be $20 a week and be purchased from campus grocery store to have a closed loop economy.
- invite professors/TAs to do their office hours here for certain weeks
- Why:
  * since macleod is being remodelled we need a common place for ECE students to reach each other and build community around. We will be
  spread all over the campus since we don't have a set building and ECE will lose out on culture if we don't have a place to be on campus.

ECE Newsletter Student of the Week each week + Student/TA of the Class each semester + Prof of the Week
- short bio to recognize ECE students for their accomplishments inside and outside of school
- TA and Student recognition for kids who helped the class succeed or were very beneficial to the class, recommended by professors
- Do a prof of the week to get people more aware of what they are doing outside of teaching to increase relations between students and profs
