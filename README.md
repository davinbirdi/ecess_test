ECESS VPac test info board

I'm trying to see if it's viable to use Github to place our public policy for ECE. Its transparent for the public/ece students, and it gives us more transparency on who's doing what within ECE for writing and making additions to what we are doing.

It also allows us to get feedback from students. Someone can talk to us and we can open Issues/create branches or they can themselves to bring up their issues and allow other people to see them. We can print out a weekly changelog for people to see who don't access github, but otherwise this gives us a whole lot of transparency and documentation assistance.

also note that we do not commit to master but do pull requests to it which we can have our council members/ecess staff to approve.
